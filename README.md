# llm
A Python application for chunking code into smaller, manageable pieces.

The `llm` project is a Python-based tool designed to automate the generation of README files for software projects. It leverages the capabilities of RAG (Reactive Artifact Generation) to create high-quality, consistent README content.

The project consists of two primary components: 

*   `ProjectScanner`: This class scans a Python project and identifies its main directories and files.
*   `IntelligentChunker`: This class takes the output from the `ProjectScanner` and chunks the code into smaller, manageable pieces based on specific rules.

To use the `llm` project, you can follow these steps:

1.  Create a new directory for your project and add all of its files to it.
2.  Run the command `python IntelligentChunker.py` in the root directory of your project.
3.  The tool will create a README file with the chunked code.

The `llm` project relies on the following dependencies:

*   Python 3.x
*   RAG (Reactive Artifact Generation) library

You can install these dependencies by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## API Reference

## Overview of llm Project
===============

The `llm` project is a Python application designed to scan and chunk Python projects into smaller, manageable pieces. This README provides an overview of the main classes, functions, and their usage.

## Classes and Functions
------------------------

### ProjectScanner Class

#### Description

The `ProjectScanner` class is responsible for scanning a Python project and identifying its structure. It uses a list of ignore patterns to exclude certain files and directories from the scan.

#### Usage Example

```python
from llm.ProjectScanner import ProjectScanner

# Create an instance of ProjectScanner
scanner = ProjectScanner()

# Define a list of ignore patterns
ignore_patterns = [
    '__pycache__',
    '.git',
    '.venv'
]

# Set the ignore patterns for the scanner
scanner.ignore_patterns = ignore_patterns

# Scan the project and get the chunked code
chunked_code = scanner.scan_project('/path/to/project')
```

### IntelligentChunker Class

#### Description

The `IntelligentChunker` class is responsible for chunking the scanned Python project into smaller pieces. It uses a mapping handler to determine the best chunking strategy.

#### Usage Example

```python
from llm.IntelligentChunker import IntelligentChunker

# Create an instance of IntelligentChunker
chunker = IntelligentChunker(max_chunk_size=1000)

# Define a mapping handler for Python code
handler = {
    'python_code': lambda x: chunker._chunk_python_code(x)
}

# Use the chunking strategy to chunk the project
chunked_project = chunker.chunk(project_code, handler)
```

## Examples

## IntelligentChunker Module
### Overview

This module provides a structured approach to processing large datasets through text chunking. It is designed to work in conjunction with the RAG (Rhetorical Agent Generator) and can be used as part of the `llm` application.

### Usage

To use this module, import the necessary classes and functions into your Python script:

```python
from intelligentchunker import ProjectScanner, IntelligentChunker
```

Example usage:
```python
# Initialize a new instance of the ProjectScanner class
scanner = ProjectScanner()

# Scan the current directory for Python files
scanner.scan_directory()

# Chunk the scanned code into smaller pieces using the IntelligentChunker class
chunker = IntelligentChunker()
chunked_code = chunker.chunk_code(scanner.code_chunks)

# Print the chunked code to the console
print(chunked_code)
```

### Classes

#### ProjectScanner

The `ProjectScanner` class is responsible for scanning a Python project directory and extracting relevant code.

*   `scan_directory()`: Scans the current directory for Python files.
*   `get_scanned_code()`: Returns a list of dictionaries containing the scanned code.

Example usage:
```python
# Initialize a new instance of the ProjectScanner class
scanner = ProjectScanner()

# Scan the current directory for Python files
scanner.scan_directory()

# Print the scanned code to the console
for chunk in scanner.get_scanned_code():
    print(chunk)
```

#### IntelligentChunker

The `IntelligentChunker` class is responsible for processing the extracted code and chunking it into smaller pieces.

*   `chunk_code(code_chunks)`: Takes a list of dictionaries containing the scanned code and returns a list of chunked code strings.
*   `get_chunk_size()`: Returns the optimal size for each chunk.

Example usage:
```python
# Initialize a new instance of the IntelligentChunker class
chunker = IntelligentChunker()

# Chunk the scanned code using the chunk_code method
chunked_code = chunker.chunk_code(scanner.code_chunks)

# Print the chunked code to the console
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunked_code):
    print(f"Chunk {i+1}: {chunk}")
```

### Requirements

This module requires Python 3.6 or later and the following dependencies:
